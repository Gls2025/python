        "The analysis of housing prices reveals several key trends:\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall Trend: Average housing prices show a gradual increase across the years in the dataset. For example, mean sale prices rose from around $140,000 in 2006 to approximately $170,000 in 2010, indicating a steady upward trend.\n",
        "\n",
        "Seasonality: Prices display seasonal variation. Houses sold during the summer months (June–July) tend to have higher average prices, while winter months (December–January) see lower prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Distribution: The distribution of prices is right-skewed, with a median value around $163,000 and a smaller set of very high-priced homes pulling up the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion: Housing prices have generally increased over time, with evidence of seasonal fluctuations and a skewed distribution driven by high-value outliers. These findings suggest both long-term market growth and short-term seasonal dynamics influence the prices."
